All code used was created by me, however some reference from the lectures and https://www.w3schools.com/ was used.
the website was used as a tool to learn some extra specifics like the spaces between my links in the nav section.
Color Palette is attached however With that I also added #ffa4d9.

Currently do not have a working microphone so for the video it is just a random downloaded clip I have.
Also Unfortunately did this project majorily on VSCODE on my desktop and uploaded it all after from my laptop. 
My apologies for having no commits I read that at the end my fault. May be some after website work.
Site is also deployed with git as heroku said no free trials and 000webhost had an internal error when I attempted to make an account.
